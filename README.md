# MES Printing Server

The MES Printing Server provides GUI for Monash engineering students to submit and monitor 3D model printing jobs.
Printing jobs are executed by calling Octo APIs to 3D printers in the lab, and real time printing data is
synchronized to the OPCUA server, which is the central control of the lab.

MES works with other systems (matrix, storage...) to provide automated printing services:

* students submit printing jobs
* jobs are picked and executed
* finished plates are picked by robots to storage
* students get notified and come to the lab
* models are picked from storage to students
